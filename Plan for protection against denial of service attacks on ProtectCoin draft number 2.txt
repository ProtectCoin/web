Plan for protection against denial of service attacks on ProtectCoin

Overall I think one of our best defenses is that we are (probably) working under the radar of any attackers right now. I suggest we do a silent launch of ProtectCoin to keep us under the radar for as long as possible. By silent launch I mean that when we have mined the first block we don't rush out and make a public announcement. Instead we first make sure that all the active participants in this project have set up all the things they want to contribute with (nodes, miners, and maybe also exchanges) and necessary infrastruture before we can scale up. An example of such infrastructure is DNS server. Bitcoin nodes typically uses DNS servers to find other nodes to connect to. See http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/ch06.html#_network_discovery. We must have a number of such DNS servers configured correctly before we go public. Secondly we write private messages (email, Facebook, forums etc) to people we believe will and can support our new cryptocurrency. When we have contacted the most obvious candidates, we tell the second most obvious candidates and so forth. Eventually we will start seeing attacks or the news about our project hits the news or we run out of good candidates to contact directly. At that time we can open up for our main website and make public announcements on https://bitco.in/forum/, https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/, https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt, https://news.bitcoin.com/, and other places where supporters can be found. 

To speed up our communication with potential supporters we must have prepared a text which can be used in all the directed messages during the silent phase. One thing I think these initial messages should contain is a complete copy of the content we plan to launch on ProtectCoin.org. That will make it easier to do a silent launch because we don't need to have a visible website. 

Another thing to think about is where attacks might eventually hit us. There are several parts of the ProtectCoin ecosystem which risk being attacked. Here is my list of potential points of attacks that we need to think about:
1. The main website (ProtectCoin.org) describing what ProtectCoin is etc
2. Individual miners
3. Mining pools
4. ProtectCoin nodes passing transactions through the ProtectCoin network
5. Exchanges where ProtectCoin can be bought and sold

Re 1. The main website (ProtectCoin.org) describing what ProtectCoin is etc

This is a central point but even if the website is completely DDOS'ed the ProtectCoin network (nodes, miners etc) can continue to run. It will however make it more difficult to get important news out, attract new users or download our software. Therefore I plan to make the site text-only. No graphics or other things which would decrease the number of simultaneous users the site can support. I would also like to make our software available from alternative download locations. P2P networks / bittorent / magnet links etc. may be a way to go. It will not only decraese the load on the main website but provide a not-very-easy-to-attack download option. I know very little about P2P file sharing so I hope to find some expert help for this. Another way to minimize the problem connected with an attack on ProtectCoin.org is to have the same content on a Tor hidden Service. I have also bought ProtectCoin.com which I have still not decided how to use. It might become home to a forum for users but in the early phases it could also be a backup site for ProtectCoin.org. On our main site we should have descriptions of how to cryptographically verify the downloads. It could be sha-256/512 sums and/or verification using pgp. That way our users can feel secure no matter how they get the software.

2. Individual miners

I have never mined before so I am not yet very familiar with how a typical setup is. I know that an Antminer S7 is connected to the network through RJ45 and it will by default use DHCP. I suppose most mining hardware is located on internal networks (192.168.x.x or similar) and are not directly attackable from the internet. I also believe most mining equipment owned by small miners are hooked up to a mining pool. Does anyone know whether the mining pool servers can directly send traffic to a miner or can the pool server only answer requests from the miner?

3. Mining pools
Mining pools are probably the most vulnerable part of the ProtectCoin Ecosystem. At present we still don't have a single person or company who has committed to having a ProtectCoin compatible mining pool. We need to have several to remove this single point of failure. One way to do it is to develop a complete suite of basic (open source) pool software and an easy way for anyone to quickly set up a mining pool. That easy way can either be a step-by-step installation instruction and/or some sort of image which can be cloned. 

4. ProtectCoin nodes passing transactions through the ProtectCoin network
This is the equivalent of a fully validating node in the bitcoin network. In the ProtectCoin networh all nodes are fully validating nodes (no spv validation to begin with) so that is why I use a different term. These nodes are important because they contain a full copy of the blockchain and they facilitate the transfer of valid transactions in the network and reject invalid transactions. I think we can quickly get many of these nodes online. An essential part of this task is to automate it so we can have a lot of them living on virtual servers living on physical servers owned by Digital Ocean, Google, Amazon and/or other cloud providers. Some of these virtual servers can be set up by those of us participating here on Telegram while others can be set up by the people we contact in the end of the silent phase or supporters in the general public. This will require some work but it is the part I am least worried about.

5. Exchanges where ProtectCoin can be bought and sold
So far we don't have any exchanges. My plan is to contact Erik Voorhees from shapeshift.io to hear if he wants to be ready for ProtectCoin support from day 1. I guess that even if that exchange is DDOS'ed other exchanges can still pop up and remove that bottle neck after our public launch. What do you think. Do we need support from more than one exchange from day 1. What about you, Niklas Nikolajsen? Can you offer buying and selling of ProtectCoin from day 1?
